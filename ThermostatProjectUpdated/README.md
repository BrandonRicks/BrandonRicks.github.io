# CS-350 Portfolio - Thermostat Project

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project makes use of many different peripherals built into the board, combining much of the work in the class together, along with some new information. It involved building the code and functionality of the board into a working thermostat, where temperature changes to the sensor on the board would cause an LED to turn on and a value to change, simulating a heater turning on.

## What did you do particularly well?
After lots of troubleshooting and trying various methods, I feel like I did well on the structure of the code and the created variables. The code is easily to follow, well commented, and the variables make sense for their intended purpose.

## Where could you improve?
As stated above, my tendancy to overthink a solution someitmes led to me rewriting this program more than once. I also have room to improve on understanding how certain peripherals can be coded.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found a lot of value in the discussion surrounding asking questions or clarification on the project. Many of the posts were applicable to my understanding of the assignment, as well as the value of asking questions to my professor. I see value in bouncing ideas and questions off of your peers. Reading the header files of the drivers in use is also very helpful.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
See a sensor on the board change the output in ther terminal, alongside the LED changing was an exciting thing. It was interesting to see all of these moving parts come together and work as intended. While working on this project, I began to understand more and more how you code peripherals to work together, particularly combining button presses with custom variables, and all of these working with the temperature sensor.

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code in this project is clean and easy to follow. I added a lot fo comments to explain lines of code, variables, functionality, etc., and kept it all logically put together. The while loop shows how each check of the timer works, and is easy to alter or build upon. It wouldn't take much work to add more tasks, alter times, adjust default values, etc.
